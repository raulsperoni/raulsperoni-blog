Principal Data Engineer with over 10 years of experience in software engineering and data solutions. Currently working in the legal tech industry. I enjoy tackling complex problems with diverse teams as a hands-on professional who navigates all project phases—from initial requirements to deployed infrastructure. Work is fulfilling when I'm delivering value, learning from others, and sharing knowledge in return.  
  
In addition to my primary role, I manage teams and projects in the civic tech space. I'm involved as a researcher and consultant in open-source initiatives that explore the intersection of democracy and technology.
